# Recommender System Model

- Implemented a recommendation system with collaborative filtering which suggests movies to individuals or to groups.
- Used Matrix Factorisation method (SGD - ADAM optimizer) with Lasso regularisation
- Worked with Sparse Matrices
- Implemented three voting methods: Borda Count, Plurality Voting and the Average of Preferences
- Solved the Cold Start problem by using cosine similarity
- Established the value fo hyperparameters experimentally

- Used numpy, pandas, scipy, BeautifulSoup and sklearn
- This model is deployed on a [Django Server](https://github.com/CristinaRacovita/django-server) and used by an [Android Client](https://github.com/CristinaRacovita/final-project)
